AirFlash supports existing two-device stereo pairs and low-latency playback from Windows.
Stream Windows desktop audio to HomePod through a native AirPlay 2 sender,
with support for HomePod OS 27.

AirFlash is an AirPlay 2 alternative to TuneBlade (AirPlay 1), designed to bring
Windows audio streaming to HomePods running newer versions of HomePod software.

## Installation

Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Ding-Kyoma/AirFlash/releases/latest), run
`AirFlash-X.Y.Z.msi`, and launch AirFlash from the installed shortcut. Apps and Features provides repair and uninstall.

AirFlash is distributed as a Windows x64 executable and standalone MSI. Windows may show
a SmartScreen warning because release binaries are not code-signed. Use
**More info** and **Run anyway** only when the downloaded files are from a
source you trust.

On Linux, download the `-full` AppImage for your architecture (`x86_64` or
`aarch64`) from the same release, make it executable, and run it:

```bash
chmod +x AirFlash-X.Y.Z-x86_64-full.AppImage
./AirFlash-X.Y.Z-x86_64-full.AppImage    # opens the graphical panel
```

No installation or root access is needed: AppImage is a single self-contained
file with the CLI, the engine and the .NET runtime inside. Running it with no
arguments opens the panel, `gui` forces the panel, and any CLI command
(`./AirFlash.AppImage discover`) drives the headless binary. To keep it on the
desktop, move it to `~/Apps` and copy the bundled `airflash-ui.desktop` entry
into `~/.local/share/applications/`. The AppImage is not code-signed; verify it
against the release's `SHA256SUMS.txt`. See [docs/LINUX.md](docs/LINUX.md) for
dependencies and known limitations.

## Linux preview

</p>

Two ways to run AirFlash on Linux, both reusing the same native sender:

- **Headless** (`airflash-cli`): discover, pair, start in the background, stop,
  inspect status and logs, change volume — no graphical desktop required.
- **Graphical panel** (`AirFlash.UI`, Avalonia): the Windows panel's layout,
  receiver list, per-device volume, equalizer, diagnostics and settings, built
  from the shared .NET Core layer.

Desktop audio capture is **not implemented yet** (PipeWire/PulseAudio), so the
Linux panel streams a simulated test signal or a WAV file. That keeps the whole
transport path real and testable, and the limitation is stated in the UI and the
documentation instead of being hidden.

```bash
airflash-cli discover
airflash-cli pair --host 192.168.1.42
airflash-cli start --host 192.168.1.42 --source simulated --daemon
airflash-cli status
airflash-cli stop
```

A repeatable build produces an x86_64 AppImage (headless only, or together with
the panel), and a `systemd --user` unit runs the sender in the background without
root. See [docs/LINUX.md](docs/LINUX.md) for dependencies, building the Avalonia
frontend, the systemd units, the AppImage layout, the audio boundaries, and the
known limitations.

## Key features

- Streams Windows system audio to HomePod over AirPlay 2.
- Supports synchronized playback on existing two-device HomePod stereo pairs.
- Offers automatic device discovery, PIN pairing, and manual device setup.
- Lets you filter device discovery by selecting a network adapter in Settings.
- Includes selectable latency modes, tray operation, mute restoration,
  automatic reconnection, and connection diagnostics.
- Provides a ten-band equalizer with presets and live preview in Settings.
- Available as a portable Windows x64 app with English and Simplified Chinese UI.

## Feature plan

- [ ] Dolby Atmos support.

## Usage

1. Connect the PC and both HomePods to the same reachable local network.
2. Start AirFlash and wait for the receiver list to populate.
3. Select the complete `HomePod stereo · 2/2` entry and press play.
4. Complete PIN pairing in **Settings > Receivers** if the receiver requests it.
5. Choose the capture endpoint and latency profile in Settings when the defaults
   are not suitable.

AirFlash intentionally uses fresh application storage under `%APPDATA%/AirFlash`
and `%LOCALAPPDATA%/AirFlash`. It does not read configuration, credentials, or
engine caches created by the previous product name; users must configure and pair
again after installing AirFlash.

Use **Settings > About > Check for updates** to check for a stable release and open its download page. Checks run only when requested.

The real-time profile targets 120 ms; target and local transport timings are not measurements of end-to-end acoustic latency.

## Stack

- **C# / .NET 10 / WPF** for the Windows UI, tray integration, settings, and discovery
- **Rust** for WASAPI capture, AirPlay 2 sessions, HAP, PTP, RTP, and audio transport
- **Windows DNS-SD** for receiver discovery
- **WASAPI loopback** for system audio capture
- **PCM and ALAC** with encrypted RTP for HomePod playback
- **uv, pytest, and Ruff** for the finite validation tools and Python checks

The published application is self-contained and statically links the native MSVC runtime. It does not require Python, a separately installed .NET runtime, or a separately installed VC++ Redistributable.

## Development and build

Development requires Windows 10/11 x64, the .NET 10 SDK, the Rust MSVC toolchain,
and Visual Studio C++/Windows SDK components. Python 3.12+ and `uv` are used for
validation scripts only.

```powershell
uv sync --locked
pwsh scripts/build-native.ps1 -Check
pwsh scripts/dotnet.ps1 restore AirFlash.sln --locked-mode
pwsh scripts/dotnet.ps1 run --project AirFlash.App/AirFlash.App.csproj
pwsh scripts/build.ps1
```

The build produces:

- `dist/AirFlash.exe`
- `dist/AirFlash-X.Y.Z.msi`

Run `AirFlash-X.Y.Z.msi` directly. It installs the self-contained executable and provides optional desktop and Start menu shortcuts.
AirFlash uses the Windows DNS-SD API and does not require Bonjour or install a background service.
The Rust engine is embedded in the WPF executable and extracted to a content-addressed cache under `%LOCALAPPDATA%/AirFlash/engine/<hash>` at runtime.

## Tests

```powershell
pwsh scripts/dotnet.ps1 test AirFlash.sln
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
pwsh scripts/build-native.ps1 -Check
```

The ignored Rust soak test uses localhost UDP receivers only. Real HomePod tests
are intentionally limited to the repository's low-volume, five-second procedure.
